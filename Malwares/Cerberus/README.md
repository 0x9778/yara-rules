Cerberus is a banking trojan designed to target Googleâ€™s Android operating system, it has many abilities including communication interception, tampering the device settings, keystroke logging or keylogging, and steal banking credentials which is the primary motive of this trojan. The trojan was first spotted in June 2019 by the Threatfabric analysts when the trojan was being leased out on forums and is targeting users through malicious websites which ask the user to download certain apps in order to use the website, once the user downloads the malicious app it asks for certain permissions which helps the trojan to get the necessary rights needed for the smooth running of the app. The group has put efforts in making sure that Antivirus apps do not detect the trojan and in one the tweets made through the twitter handle they claimed to have 0 hits in a list of well known antivirus applications. The source code leak was found on a forum after a failed auction where the malware was being sold for around $100,000.
